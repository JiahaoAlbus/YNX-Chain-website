availability, production custody, active liquidity, regulatory approval, or
listing commitment from any exchange.

## Integration overview

YNX Testnet exposes a YNX native-envelope transfer path plus a bounded
Ethereum-compatible read interface. Standard Ethereum RLP broadcast is not
supported. The canonical broadcast input is a hex-encoded
`ynx-native-json-envelope-v1`.

## Prerequisites

- Dedicated validator or full node
- Secure key management (HSM recommended for production)
- Transaction monitoring and reconciliation systems
- AML/KYC/sanctions compliance infrastructure
- Incident response and customer support workflows

## Node setup

### Running a full node

The repository does not yet publish a production exchange-node binary or a
production genesis package. Use the public read-only Testnet endpoints for
evaluation and request an independently reviewed node package before any
custody integration. Do not rely on illustrative `ynxd` commands.

### Node monitoring

- **Sync state**: Verify node is caught up before processing deposits
- **Peer health**: Maintain stable peer connections
- **Block lag**: Monitor for consensus delays or stalls
- **Disk space**: Ensure sufficient storage for chain growth
- **RPC availability**: Health check JSON-RPC and native RPC endpoints

## Deposit workflow (Native YNXT)

### Generate deposit addresses

Use unique addresses or an exchange-controlled allocation ledger. The current
candidate does not use memo/tag routing. Both lowercase `0x` and checksummed
`ynx1` forms resolve to one account; store and sign with the canonical lowercase
`0x` form.

### Monitor incoming transactions

Use `eth_getBlockByNumber`, `eth_getTransactionByHash`,
`eth_getTransactionReceipt`, and bounded `eth_getLogs`. Pause crediting on block
identity mismatch, observed reorg, or indexer lag.

### Confirmation policy

- **Fixture minimum**: 2 blocks, for deterministic candidate evidence only
- **Production threshold**: not approved; pause credits until an exchange and
  network operator approve it
- **Finality evidence**: the public candidate uses an authoritative
  producer/follower model and does not claim public BFT finality or proven reorg
  resistance

### Credit user balance

Once confirmations are met and the transaction is verified:

1. Parse amount and recipient from transaction events
2. Match to user account (by address or memo)
3. Credit internal balance
4. Record transaction hash, height, and timestamp for audit

## Withdrawal workflow (Native YNXT)

### Validate withdrawal request

- Verify user has sufficient internal balance
- Check withdrawal address format (bech32 with `ynx` prefix)
- Apply withdrawal limits and AML/sanctions screening
- Deduct internal balance before broadcasting

### Broadcast transaction

Build and sign the canonical YNX native JSON envelope, then submit it to
`POST /transactions/broadcast` as JSON or to `eth_sendRawTransaction` as the
`0x`-prefixed hex encoding of that exact canonical envelope.

### Monitor transaction status

Query `eth_getTransactionByHash` and `eth_getTransactionReceipt`. Exact duplicate
broadcasts are idempotent and must return the same transaction hash.

Check for:
- `code: 0` (success)
- Block height and timestamp
- Events confirming transfer

### Handle failures

If a withdrawal transaction fails:
- Parse error code and message
- Refund user's internal balance if not broadcasted or rejected
- Log failure for investigation
- Retry with adjusted gas or corrected parameters

## EVM integration (ERC-20 tokens)

YNX Testnet supports Ethereum JSON-RPC. Exchanges can integrate ERC-20 tokens
using standard Ethereum tooling.

### JSON-RPC endpoint

```
https://rpc.ynxweb4.com/evm
```

### Web3 integration

```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const web3 = new Web3('https://rpc.ynxweb4.com/evm');

// Check balance
const balance = await web3.eth.getBalance(address);

// Monitor ERC-20 transfers
const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(ERC20_ABI, tokenAddress);
contract.events.Transfer({ filter: { to: depositAddress } }, (error, event) => {
  // Credit user balance
});
```

### Gas and fees

- **Gas token**: Native YNXT is used for EVM gas
- **Gas price**: `eth_gasPrice` is currently unsupported
- **Estimation**: `eth_estimateGas` is not exchange-safe in this candidate

## Hot/cold wallet architecture

- **Hot wallet**: Online, automated withdrawals with limited funds
- **Cold wallet**: Offline, multi-sig, bulk replenishment only
- **Warm wallet**: Semi-automated, manual approval for large withdrawals
- **Reconciliation**: Daily balance checks between blockchain and internal ledger

## Fee structure

Exchanges determine their own deposit/withdrawal fees. On-chain costs include:

- **Native transfer**: Minimal (fixed fee or dynamic gas)
- **EVM transactions**: Gas cost in YNXT
- **Contract interactions**: Higher gas for complex operations

## Testnet limitations

- **No monetary value**: YNXT is a Testnet asset with no represented value
- **Reset risk**: Testnet may be reset without notice; not suitable for production
- **Liquidity**: No guaranteed orderbook depth or external liquidity
- **Custody**: Production-grade custody, insurance, and reserve proof are not claimed
- **Regulatory status**: Testnet integration does not imply regulatory approval
  for Mainnet listing

## Mainnet readiness

Before Mainnet integration, exchanges must verify:

1. **Network launch**: Official Mainnet announcement and genesis
2. **Token supply**: Final allocation, circulating supply, and vesting schedules
3. **Liquidity**: Market depth, price discovery, and volatility
4. **Custody**: Secure key management, insurance, and operational procedures
5. **Compliance**: AML/KYC, sanctions, licensing, and reporting obligations
6. **Support**: Customer service, incident response, and dispute resolution
7. **Legal review**: Token classification, listing jurisdiction, and risk disclosure

## Security checklist

- [ ] HSM or secure enclave for hot wallet signing
- [ ] Multi-signature cold wallet with offline signing
- [ ] Withdrawal velocity limits and anomaly detection
- [ ] AML/sanctions screening on deposits and withdrawals
- [ ] Transaction replay protection and nonce management
- [ ] Regular reconciliation between chain state and internal ledger
- [ ] Incident response plan for chain halts, rollbacks, or attacks
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures for keys and database

## Support and coordination

For Testnet integration assistance:

- Genesis files and RPC endpoints: network coordinator
- Token metadata and chainlist submission: `docs/ecosystem/`
- AML/sanctions provider integration: `docs/compliance/PROVIDER_REGISTER.md`
- Technical issues: GitHub Issues or developer support channel

## Change log

  Ethereum broadcast claims with verified envelope, RPC, confirmation, address
  and endpoint boundaries.
- 0.1.0-candidate (2026-07-23): Initial exchange integration guide covering node
  setup, deposits, withdrawals, EVM support, custody, Testnet limitations, and
  Mainnet readiness checklist.
